# Metagenomic_project_BF
Repository created for tutorial project CIBiG_2024

## Description
This document provides the steps to follow for a metagenomic analysis of data from environmental (water) samples (Urban et al., 2021; https://elifesciences.org/articles/61504) 
generated on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform. This is part of a training course leading to an International Certificate in Bioinformatics and Genomics (CIBiG). The aim is to define and implement the analysis steps and provide scripts to ensure reproducibility.

By using this platform, the user will be able to reproduce all the results presented in this project.

## Objective of this training
By submitting this tutored project, our supervisors' focus is to ensure that we will not only be able to perform bioinformatics analyses, but also that we will be able to interpret the results we obtain. The specific aim is to detect contaminants in water using metagenomics analysis.
At the end of this training or tutored project, we should be able to:
- Acquire specific technical skills (pre-processing of sequencing data, sequence assembly)
- Deepen theoretical knowledge of water contaminants
- Analyze data (practical use of real data)

## Project description :  Development and implementation of an analysis plan for metagenomic data generated on an ONT platform
While traditional freshwater microbiological tests focus on the detection of specific bacterial indicator species, including pathogens, direct tracing of all aquatic DNA using metagenomics offers an interesting alternative. However, in situ water metagenomic studies face considerable cost and logistical challenges. 
Using defined compositions and the spatio-temporal microbiota of surface water from an example river in Cambridge (UK), we provide here guidelines for bioinformatic analyses. At the end of this work, based on the data provided, we hope to gain a better understanding of the community of water contaminants, while specifying the most predominant ones.
These data come from environmental (water) samples (Urban et al., 2021; https://elifesciences.org articles/61504). The data are available for download from ENA at the following link: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB34900
In practice, we will need to define and carry out the analysis steps and make the scripts available to ensure reproducibility.

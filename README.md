# Metagenomic_project_BF
Repository created for tutorial project CIBiG_2024

## Description
Our project involves developing and implementing an analysis plan for metagenomic data generated on an ONT platform.
These data come from environmental samples (water) (Urban et al., 2021; https://elifesciences.org/articles/61504).
The aim is to define and implement the analysis steps and make the scripts available to ensure reproducibility.

By using this platform, the user will be able to reproduce all the results presented in this project.
